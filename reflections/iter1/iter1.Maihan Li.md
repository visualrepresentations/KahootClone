# End of Iteration Individual Reflection

Iteration: 1  
Date: 14/10/2025

Answer briefly (dot points are fine):

1. What are the 2-3 most valuable contributions you made this iteration? (link issues/PRs)
    - I finished my 2 functions and their testing.
    - When other team members found problems with my function, I actively discussed it with them and corrected it in time.


2. What went well in how you worked? (planning, communication, code quality, collaboration)
    - The planning is ok, so there is no big problem with my code.
    - There is no problem with the overall code quality, but there may be some problems such as some parts are forgotten or do not     match other functions.

3. What could you improve next time? (skills, habits, process)
    - My coding skills need to be improved
    - Improve my English skills so that I can communicate effectively with more team members
