## What went well for your group this iteration?
1. We got it done
2. No hiccups (things went smoothly)

## What didn't go well for your group this iteration?
1. Coordination/Communication
2. Naming branches/merge requests etc (did not follow a standard naming convention)
3. Housekeeping (Group reflection/individual reflection)

## What could you do better next iteration? 
1. Thoroughly read the entire spec for any tasks non-coding related that we must complete for the iteration
2. Use the issue board more (so there are no confusions about who is doing what task)
3. Try to make sure our code passes all of the autotests before merging (pipeline should fix this)
