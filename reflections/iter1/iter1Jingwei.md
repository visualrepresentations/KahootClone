# End of Iteration Individual Reflection

Iteration: 1  
Date: 13/10/2025

Answer briefly (dot points are fine):

1. What are the 2-3 most valuable contributions you made this iteration? (link issues/PRs)
        - Did my 3 functions early so that the people with functions downstream could start working on them earlier
        - Reviewed a lot of merge requests

2. What went well in how you worked? (planning, communication, code quality, collaboration)
        - Planning was good
        - Code quality was good

3. What could you improve next time? (skills, habits, process)
        - Read the spec more carefully (I tested for specific error messages and had to change all of my tests because of this)
