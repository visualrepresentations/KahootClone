Answer briefly (dot points are fine):

1. What are the 2-3 most valuable contributions you made this iteration? (link issues/PRs)
        - I wrote my code in a simple way with easy to understand comments and concepts
        - Did housekeeping, reviewed many tests and functions, and fixed them if the person who wrote them was having issues.
        - Read and accepted many merge requests

2. What went well in how you worked? (planning, communication, code quality, collaboration)
        - The planning out of functions went smoothly, with straight forward logic
        - Code quality was great, written especially to use easy-to-understand concepts and operations

3. What could you improve next time? (skills, habits, process)
        - Properly reading the specifications for the iteration to avoid not knowing about certain rules and having to change code
        - Have better merging habits
