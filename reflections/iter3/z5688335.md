# End of Iteration Individual Reflection

Iteration: 2  
Date: 3/11/2025

Answer briefly (dot points are fine):

1. What are the 2-3 most valuable contributions you made this iteration? (link issues/PRs)
    - When I was given upstream functions I made sure to finish them as soon as possible, i worked on them in order to ensure that team members had ample time to complete their tasks
    - Another valuable contribution i made was leading the team strictly within meetings and ensuring clear deadline and task allocation, allowed for a continuous shared team goal throughout


2. What went well in how you worked? (planning, communication, code quality, collaboration)
  - Communication was essential within the iteration between team members, at least one member in the team was available to merge in a MR, often i was online.
  - Planning also went well, we were able to go through the tasks required of us in detail.

3. What could you improve next time? (skills, habits, process)
  - I think we could improve through being more thorough with my work, ensuring that my code coverage is up to par.
