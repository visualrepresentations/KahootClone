1. When and where will we schedule meetings (e.g. 11am Wednesdays and 2pm Fridays: in-person at X location, or on Teams video call)?
 Due to locational disparity between team members, we will meet at UNSW on Fridays 5-6-7-pm, In the case where no one is able to make it we will host our meetings on discord

2. How will meeting hosts be planned so that team members share the leading of meetings equally?
We will go clockwise by alphabetical order, ensuring each person will have a chance to speak

3. Where will we record our meeting minutes (Gitlab Wiki or Gitlab markdown file)?
We will have a separate discord channel where we will record each meeting's minutes

4. How many days before the iteration due date do we expect individual tasks to be completed by (i.e. when is our internal deadline(s))? 
Two days before to account for any uncontrollable life factors that may get in the way

5. What is the expected response time for messages/posts on MS Teams when communicating with each other?
Discord - instant
Instagram - 30 minutes
MS Teams - 1 day

6. What is the expected turn-around time for reviewing merge requests? What is our approach to conducting code reviews?
Whenever someone pings a member on discord they will review it. Our approach to conducting code reviews is to test if the code works and look at the style of the code, and if it works the merge request will be accepted

7. How will we handle conflicts (i.e. differing opinions)? Note: If conflicts cannot resolved this way, please contact your tutor.
We will host a tribunal on discord. We will try to resolve the conflict between the member(s) involved, and ultimately host a vote each meeting.

8. List the steps a team member does if they get stuck (e.g. stuck debugging).
- Try to fix it themselves
- Ask other group members for help
- We will organise on a discord call and the person needing help will screenshare, and we will debug it as a group



9. A day before the due date we notice a team member's work is very broken and incomplete. Instead of waiting until the due date, list the steps we will take to prevent this from occuring in the first place. Note: contact your tutor if this happens as well. 
Every week during the in-person meeting we will check each individual's work as a group, reviewing the functionality and style of the code.
